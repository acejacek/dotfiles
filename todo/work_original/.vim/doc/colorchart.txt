The functionality mentioned here is a plugin, see |add-plugin|.
You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "ColorChart_loaded" global
variable in your |vimrc| file: >
    :let g:ColorChart_loaded = 1

1. Introduction                                               *colorchart-intro*

This plugin provides a single command, |:ColorChart|, and a single function,
|ColorChart()|.  They are functionally identical except for the way in which
they are called.  The sole purpose of this plugin is to provide a visual
representation of the palette being used by terminal Vim, and in particular
the 88- or 256-color color cube.  As such, it is useless in GUI Vim - it won't
even be loaded, in fact.

After running :ColorChart, a new window will appear allowing you to navigate
around a visual representation of the available color palette.  Moving the
cursor to one of the colored blocks will show information about that color
below the chart.  In a 256 color terminal, this information includes the hex
colors for how it would be rendered by Konsole, by Eterm, and by most (all?)
other 256-color terminal emulators.  Three lines at the top of the screen let
you change the shape that the palette is displayed in and the order in which
the colors are organized on it.  Mappings are provided to make it possible to
change these options without needing to move the cursor, namely -, +, {, }, [,
and ].

2. Requirements                                      *colorchart-requirements*

For colorchart to work, you must be running Vim in a terminal and your terminal
must report that it supports colors, either through the terminfo or termcap
database (depending on whether Vim was compiled with |+terminfo|) that it
supports colors.  This plugin will be much more useful, though, if the
terminal reports supporting at least 88 colors.  You can check with the
following Vim command:
>
    :set t_Co?
<
                                                         *colorchart-terminal*
If that reports only 8 or 16 colors, it means that your terminal either
doesn't support 88 or 256 colors, or, more likely, that it isn't properly
configured to tell applications how many it really supports.

Many modern terminals support 88 or 256 colors, but most of these default to
setting $TERM to something generic (usually "xterm").  Since Vim uses the
value of the "colors" attribute for the current $TERM in terminfo to figure
out the number of colors used internally as 't_Co', this plugin will work best
if 't_Co' is overridden to 88 or 256 in |vimrc|, or if $TERM is correctly set
to something that implies high color support.  Possible choices include
"xterm-256color" for 256 color support and "rxvt-unicode" for 88 color
support.
                                                 *colorchart-terminal-example*
To turn on high color support without fixing $TERM, you can change t_Co in
your .vimrc.  One way would be to put something like this into your |vimrc|:
>
    if (&term == 'xterm' || &term =~? '^screen') && hostname() == 'my-machine'
        " On my machine, I use Konsole with 256 color support
        set t_Co=256
    endif

Gnome Terminal, as of the time that I am writing this, doesn't support having
the terminal emulator set $TERM to something adequately descriptive.  In cases
like this, something like the following would be appropriate:
>
    if &term =~ '^\(xterm\|screen\)$' && $COLORTERM == 'gnome-terminal'
      set t_Co=256
    endif

3. Acknowledgments                                *colorchart-acknowledgments*

The idea for this plugin, and the basic framework for the implementation, were
borrowed from the "hicolors" plugin by Dr. Chip.

The different shapes for the color cubes, and the logic for viewing those
shapes with different tranforms for the origin location and the viewing angle,
come from xterm_colour_chart2.py, by Ian Ward.

5. Contact Info                                            *colorchart-author*

Your author, a Vim nerd with some free time, really enjoys seeing terminals
look pretty.  He'd like to be notified of any problems you find - after all,
he took the time to write all this lovely documentation, and this plugin.  You
can contact him with any problems or praises at mjw@drexel.edu
