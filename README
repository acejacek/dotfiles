This git repository contains my dotfiles.

Mainly:
- bashrc (80% ok)
- vimrc (pretty complete; rocks with python, still some stuff to do with other languages)
- unison (to synchronise one's boxes)
- git (Yo dawg..)

Note: this repository contains modules (in .vim/bundle). You have to execute proper git commands to have them in your repository when you clone/update it.
I have created two simple scripts (init_submodules.sh and update_submodules.sh) for these two respective tasks.
